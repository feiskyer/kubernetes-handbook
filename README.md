Kubernetes is an open-source container cluster management system developed by Google. It is the open-source version of Google's large-scale container management technology Borg and one of the most important projects of CNCF. Its main features include:

* Container-based application deployment, maintenance, and rolling upgrades
* Load balancing and service discovery
* Cluster scheduling across machines and regions
* Automatic scaling
* Stateless services and stateful services
* Extensive volume support
* Plugin mechanism to ensure scalability

Kubernetes has developed rapidly and has become a leader in the field of container orchestration. There is also a wealth of Chinese resources for Kubernetes, but there are relatively few systematic ones that keep up with community updates. The "Kubernetes Handbook" open-source e-book aims to organize reference guides and practice summaries for development and use of Kubernetes, forming a systematic reference guide for easy access. Everyone is welcome to follow and contribute.
