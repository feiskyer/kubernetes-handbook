# Storage Plugins

Kubernetes has an extensive array of [Volume](../../concepts/objects/volume.md) and [Persistent Volume](../../concepts/objects/persistent-volume.md) plugins available that can provide persistent storage solutions for containers based on various requirements.

If the built-in Volume options do not meet the needs, it's possible to create custom Volume plugins using [FlexVolume](flex-volume.md) or the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](csi.md).

# The Toolbox of Storage Solutions in Kubernetes

In the world of Kubernetes, a treasure chest of [Volume](../../concepts/objects/volume.md) and [Persistent Volume](../../concepts/objects/persistent-volume.md) plugins is at your disposal, ready to arm your containers with lasting storage capabilities tailored to fit your needs.

Should your storage challenges extend beyond what's already provided, you have the power to build your own custom Volume plugins through the versatile [FlexVolume](flex-volume.md) or by tapping into the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](csi.md) superhighway.
