# High Availability in Applications

## General Principles of Application High Availability

* Applications adhere to [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/zh_cn/)
* Employ Services and deploy applications with multiple replica Pods
* Multiple replicas use anti-affinity to avoid application failure due to single node faults
* Utilize PodDisruptionBudget to prevent application downtime resulting from evictions
* Use preStopHook and health check probes to ensure smooth service updates

## Graceful Shutdown

Configure terminationGracePeriodSeconds for Pods and use a preStop hook to delay the shutting down of container applications to avoid application interruptions during events such as `kubectl drain`:

```yaml
restartPolicy: Always
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
containers:
- image: nginx
  lifecycle:
    preStop:
      exec:
        command: [
          "sh", "-c",
          # Introduce a delay to the shutdown sequence to wait for the
          # pod eviction event to propagate. Then, gracefully shutdown
          # nginx.
          "sleep 5 && /usr/sbin/nginx -s quit",
        ]
```

Ensuring that your apps never miss a beat, even while you update your digital orchestra, is what high availability is all about. Let's consider the finely-tuned best practices:

- Treat your applications to the modern methodology of [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/zh_cn/), ensuring they're as resilient as they are refined.
- Set up your software symphony using Services and a chorus of multiple replica Pods, each singing the same tune.
- Should one Pod face the music alone, anti-affinity keeps the performance going by avoiding single node failures that hit a sour note.
- Employ PodDisruptionBudget like a metronome, keeping rhythm and preventing evictions from throwing you off-beat.
- PreStopHook and health check probes act like the meticulous conductor, guaranteeing each transition is as smooth as the last.

When it's time for a swan song, here's how you can bring the curtain down on your Pods with elegance and poise:

Set the stage with `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and cue the preStop hook to dim the lights gently. This way, when the crowd gets rowdy with `kubectl drain` commands, your application can exit stage left without dropping a line.

```yaml
restartPolicy: Always
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
containers:
- image: nginx
  lifecycle:
    preStop:
      exec:
        command: [
          "sh", "-c",
          # This little intermission gives your Pods time to pass the news
          # of their departure. Then, like the grand finale of a symphony,
          # Nginx takes a graceful bow.
          "sleep 5 && /usr/sbin/nginx -s quit",
        ]
```
